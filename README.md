# Product:
"KNC is Kerberised NetCat. It works in basically the same way as either netcat or stunnel except that it is uses GSS-API to secure the communication. You can use it to construct client/server applications while keeping the Kerberos libraries out of your programs address space quickly and easily."

## Vulnerability:
knc (Kerberised NetCat) before 1.11-1 is vulnerable to denial of service (memory exhaustion) that can be exploited remotely without authentication, possibly affecting another services running on the targeted host.

The knc implementation uses a temporary buffer in read_packet() function that is not freed (memory leak). An unauthenticated attacker can abuse this by sending a blob of valid kerberos handshake structure but with unexpected type; instead of token type AP_REQ (0x0100) I sent 0x0000 at bytes 16 and 17 in my proof of concept. During the attack, gss_sec_accept_context returns G_CONTINUE_NEEDED and the memory is exhausted in the long run.

The attack might not even be logged, depending on how the Open Source Kerberos Tooling stack is configured.
